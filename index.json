Mark will start and show you how to access Python on your machine, and how to set up your text editor. Then you'll write your first code-- the Hello World program with Python.  You'll execute your code using the command line-- which is how true programmers do it! As you continue to learn to code, Mark will review variables.  You'll create a string variable and an integer variable and display the values of those variables within your command line.  Next, it's on to conditional statements-- which is how Python programs make decisions.  You'll also learn how to take command line input in Python. Mark will wrap up the video with a demonstration of loops-- another important primary coding structure.   While this isn't the only video you should watch on coding, it IS the first one you should watch.
